Introduction
------------
This roller script set is written for tintin & wintin.
If you use cmud or zmud or other mud clients, you can still download wintin (free), 
roll your character. And switch back to your preferred mud client after character
creation.

Objectives & Overview
---------------------
The objective of this roller is to provide a level playing field between those
who can code and those who can't with respect to character generation. It is not
the goal of the roller to give you a 'powerful' character fast as that is limited
by the nature of the PRNG (pseudo random number generator) on the server side.

Credits
-------
Thanks to Lohrr for confirming the following:
1. All stats less than good will be bumped to 80 (base) after character generation
2. Excellent = 92 (base) during character generation

Features
--------
1. Three user configurable heuristics for minimum stat acceptance, bonus roll 
assignments and stat swap decisions. User-friendly built-in aliases available for 
that.

2. Can be fully automated
- Able to assign bonuses and swap stats automatically in case you happen to be 
away from keyboard while waiting, or busy with something, so that you won't lose 
'character' due to session inactivity and DC.
- if you prefer to assign bonuses yourself, you can disable the full automation
feature, stats swap must also be manually done in this case.

3. provide stats logging in html (can be disabled) to gather statistics

4. provide mud logging in html (disabled by default)

5. experimental feature : tries to reconnect and resume rolling if the mud 
reboots (not tested)

                              INSTRUCTIONS
                              
*******************************************************************************
1. Download wintin/tintin from here: http://tintin.sourceforge.net/download.php
If you are using windows, download wintin.

2. Install the app (or build the app if on linux). If you are using windows 8, 
it will be installed under "Users", inside "Roaming" directory under "AppData". 
AppData is a hidden directory and you can view it by manipulating "folder options" 
and check on 'show hidden files/directories' option (google it if you still don't 
know how). There should be a wintin shortcut made on your desktop, and you can always
right-click, choose properties, and check the location of the installed files in
this manner.

3. Copy all the scripts into the installed location. After rolling your character,
you will find 2 files (.tmp.tin and .tmp2.tin). Your password is stored in clear
text in these files to support reconnection feature, so avoid using sensitive 
passwords (like those you use for your bank accounts and other important stuff :P)
You can delete these files after rolling, or leave them there since they won't
affect a new character generation process.

4. Launch wintin from installed location or use the desktop shortcut.

5. Type the following:
#read chargen.tin
This will load all the scripts, aliases and variables needed.

6. Configuration commands/aliases and their syntax:
a. showstatcfg
--------------
Shows the current configuration. If you have not yet configured anything, it
will show you the defaults.

b. statweight <positive integer>
--------------------------------
Configures the total minimum acceptable weight before accepting the rolls.
Currently, the weights of scores are given in _chargen-roller-cfg.tin as follows:
   good = 1
   v.good = 3
   excellent = 5
So setting the the statweight value to 12 will be akin to aiming for: 4 v.gds, OR
2 excellents and 2 goods, and so on and so forth.
If you want to decide on your own weightage or even ignore 'good' scores (zero it), 
feel free to modify this file, though it's not recommended for people who don't 
know what they are doing.

From testing, recommended values would be 12-13, which should take less than
10000 rolls (1-5 hours or so).
Scores of 15-16 have been achieved in 18-24 hours before.
The improbability of achieving higher weights increases exponentially, and weights
that go beyond 16 may take unreasonably long and thus not recommended.

Syntax example:
statweight 12
<Enter>

c. statcfg <1-9> <Str|Pow|Dex|Int|Agi|Wis|Con|Cha|Luc>
------------------------------------------------------
Configures the priority list to aid the roller in assigning bonuses and swapping
stats.
The first argument takes a value from 1-9 (1 being highest priority, 9 lowest).
The second argument gives the stat for the priority assignment.
The priorites are managed in a list and you should have all 9 unique stats inside.
The script will prevent you from proceeding with the character rolling if you
do not set this list correctly. Use 'showstatcfg' to view what you've set so far.

Syntax example for setting constituion as highest priority (case is important):
statcfg 1 Con
<Enter>

d. statcfg2 <1-4>
-----------------
Configures a heuristic value to tell the roller how many v.gds you wish to convert
to excellents through bonus rolls. The final result actually depends on your
accepted rolls that are in line with the 'statweight' you set.
Accepts a value of 1-4.

If you have set it to 4, what it means is that it will try to assign bonus rolls
as best as possible to end up with 4 excellents post-assignment. 
Bonus rolls will never be assigned to naturally rolled excellents (92-100) in 
order to not accidentally waste the bonus rolls.
If you have set it to 2, you have a good chance of ending up with 2 guaranteed
excellents of 96+ scores.

For simplicity, a higher value results in more balanced excellents, while 
a lower value results in more focused and possibly stronger excellents in the
top prioritized stats.

The algorithm will try to avoid wasting rolls, so you will never have bonuses
added to naturally rolled excellents (92-100), and the only way you might have
3 bonuses assigned to a very good is when one of the first two v.gds rolled
are actually exactly 86 (detectable by the script) and your heuristic value is 
2 or less (max wastage/loss from bonus assignments in this scenario is 1 point).

Syntax example for setting a heuristic value of 2:
statcfg2 2
<Enter>

Recommended values are either 2 (more focused) or 4 (more balanced).


7. After using statweight, statcfg, and statcfg2 to configure your roller, you
are ready to start the character generation process.
But before that, you can also customize a few other things:

e. statauto <0|1>
-----------------
Enable or disable full automation. By default, full automation is enabled. If
disabled, you need to assign bonus rolls and swap stats manually.
1 - enable
0 - disable

Syntax example for disabling full automation:
statauto 0
<Enter>

If you disable full automation, you need only to do statweight as the rest of the
configuration becomes meaningless.

f. enablelog <0|1>
------------------
Enable or disable mud logging. By default disabled. If enabled, mud output will
be captured in a log file in html format. The log file can be found inside the
same directory.
1 - enable
0 - disable

Syntax example for enabling mud logging:
enablelog 1
<Enter>

g. enablestats <0|1>
--------------------
Enable or disable stats logging. By default enabled. Statistics are collected.
They include values of all the rolls, number of rolls made, time taken, and 
also show you how the bonuses were assigned and swapped after a set of rolls is 
accepted.
1 - enable
0 - disable

Syntax example for disable stats logging:
enablestats 0
<Enter>

You may choose to disable stats to save disk space. A day of rolling should result
in a stats file of about 100 MB.


7. Finally we can start, use the 'duris' alias:
duris
<Enter>

And proceed with your character generation as per normal.
